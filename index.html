            "Film Festival Rebuild"
        </h2>
        <p>
        The original Orlando Film Festival (O.F.F.) website had numerous accessibility, aesthetic, and architectural choices that were not ideal.
        Our group rebuilt the site from the ground up and even created a website that highlighted the festivals qualities.

        </h1>
        <p>
        While the original Department of the Interior (DOI) website was aesthetically pleasing, it was missing key details about what it actually does.
        This redesign is focused around helping users understand what the DOI actually does while making the aesthetic feel more unique.
